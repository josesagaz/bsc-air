# Journalists jailed

Journalists Alejandra Salinas, Orestes Sotomayor and Yesmy Marquez were detained on New Year’s Eve, accused of “sedition” for their criticism of Bolivia’s de facto regime. This follows an indictment sent to the TV station ATB which accuses members of La Resistencia Radio of “sedition” (see [La Resistencia Bolivia][1]{:target="_blank"})

The remaining members of La Resistencia Bolivia are living in fear of imminent arrest. The coup regime of self-declared President Jeanine Añez is systematically violating human rights and the right to free expression. Earlier today, two of the detained activists, Alejandra and Orestes, were subjected to an unjust hearing, with a last minute change of judge and of schedule. The judge put Alejandra under house arrest and Orestes was sent to the notorious San Pedro prison for six months. We have not been able to find out what has happened to our friend Yesmy. We demand the immediate release of our activist friends and that all charges against them are dropped.

Edit: Yesmy has been released from detention, it is alleged that she agreed to make a declaration. Also, it should be pointed out that she is not a member of La Resistencia, although she is an activist against the coup regime.
