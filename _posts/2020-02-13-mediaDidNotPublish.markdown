 </p>
Mexican photographer Narciso Contreras shared with Aristegui News photographs
and videos that recorded the slaughter of indigenous Bolivians at the time of
the coup, images that the mainstream media and news agencies did not want to
resume or publish, with no explanation about this decision, says the Mexican
photojournalist.
