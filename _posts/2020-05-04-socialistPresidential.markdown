The presidential candidate of the Movement for Socialism in Bolivia, Luis Arce
Catacora, talks about COVID-19 being used as a pretext to postpone elections,
the economic policies of the coup government, and the approach his party plans
to take.

Five months after the coup in Bolivia, Luis Arce is the presidential candidate
for Evo Morales’s Movement for Socialism (MAS). Journalist Oliver Vargas
interviewed him about the post-coup regime, its handling of coronavirus—and what
the delayed election means for the Left’s chances of returning to power. 


As the first wave of coronavirus infections hit Latin America, various
governments across the continent begin countermeasures. Yet alongside Jair
Bolsonaro’s Brazil, Bolivia distinguished itself by the incompetence of its
response—a combination of inaction and repression. This is, perhaps, no
surprise, given the disastrous political situation in the country since the
military coup last November.


In the months following the overthrow of Evo Morales, the coup regime has
expelled hundreds of Cuban doctors and medical personnel, drastically reduced
the level of cooperation with Russia and China, and halted large-scale health
care projects begun under Morales’ administration, such as the Unified Health
System (Sistema Unico de Salud). Since the coup, a number of social programs,
such as the Bono Juancito Pinto, Bono Juana Azurduy and Renta Dignidad cash
transfer schemes, have been either cut drastically or effectively discontinued.


At the same time, the regime has used the crisis to mount an authoritarian
crackdown. While those who breach curfew and quarantine measures risk up to 10
years’ imprisonment, the government has done nothing to guarantee financial
assistance or even job security for workers. This has led to riots throughout
the working class suburbs in El Alto and Oruro, and at least 1,200 arrests. This
is in addition to the persecution of hundreds of social activists and militants
of Morales’s Movement for Socialism (MAS) over the past few months.


This has also had an effect on the planned re-run of the presidential election.
Bolivia’s Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) —now headed by [Salvador Romero][salvador]{:target="_blank"}, a
well-known associate of the right-wing presidential candidate Carlos Mesa—has
decided to postpone the contest to a yet-unidentified date in July or October.
This further complicates Bolivia’s already fragmented electoral map, where MAS
remains the leading party. In the weeks prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, most
polls showed MAS candidate Luis Arce Catacora at an advanatge, capturing around
[33% of the first-round vote][33of]{:target="_blank"}— a lead of over 15% over both Mesa and post-coup
leader Jeanine Áñez.


Luis Arce Catacora, more commonly known as “Lucho,” was finance minister in
Morales’s government from 2006 until the coup in November 2019 (with a brief
absence due to health reasons in 2018). In this role, he oversaw the
nationalization of the hydrocarbon industry, the establishment of a number of
social programs, the recognition of the “social-popular” sector of the economy
and the beginning of Bolivia’s industrialization program.


He sat down together with Oliver Vargas in Cochabamba to discuss the current
situation in the country.


**Oliver Vargas (OV): Ahead of the presidential election, many people are
predicting a victory for MAS. But will it be allowed to win—and will these
elections free, fair and transparent?**


**Luis Arce (LA):** First of all, I must say that this campaign is completely
different from the previous ones. We have to deal with many factors—the de facto
[i.e., post-coup] government, the media, the supreme electoral court and all its
rules. So, we are facing a very difficult campaign.


In the latest poll, we are leading by more than 15%, but we believe that at the
end of this battle, ours will be the sole viable candidacy. Why is that? Well,
everyone is talking about it. They said MAS was dead last year and would never
recover. But less than four months on, MAS is ahead in the polls and we are sure
that we will win these elections.
