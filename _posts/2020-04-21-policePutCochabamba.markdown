### Bolivia's coup-born regime sent security forces to areas in which the Indigenous population actively rejected them.

Bolivia‚Äôs [former President Evo Morales][former]{:target="_blank"} Saturday denounced that the police
entered the Cochabamba Department without taking due sanitary precautions and
challenging the local population, which expelled several officers from the
Shinahota Municipality on Thursday.

"The Police have the constitutional power to be present throughout Bolivia.
However, their entry to the Tropics, without following sanitary protocols and
coordinating with local authorities, puts the population's health at risk,‚Äù
Morales tweeted.


The Cochabamba Tropics are between the Andean mountains and the Amazon plains.
In this region, local authorities established a strict quarantine in the
municipalities of Villa Tunari, Shinahota, Chimore, Puerto Villarroel, and Entre
Rios.


[Bolivia‚Äôs coup-born regime led by Jeanine A√±ez][coup]{:target="_blank"}, however, ordered that the Police
retake control of the Shinahota Municipality from where it was previously
expelled by the population.

Morales also denounced that the coup-born government implemented actions against
the poorest inhabitants, most of whom require help to cope with the quarantine.


"The banks closed so that people cannot access cash transfers. The sale of fuel
was prohibited to prevent my brothers from continuing to distribute free fruit
to the most humble people," the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) leader.


"Those decisions are criminal and threaten life," he added.

Besides ignoring these allegations, the A√±ez administration threatened the
Cochabamba people with criminal proceedings against them.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
