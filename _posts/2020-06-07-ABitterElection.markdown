# A close look at Bolivian election data suggests an initial analysis by the O.A.S. that raised questions of vote-rigging — and helped force out a president — was flawed.

## By Anatoly Kurmanaev and Maria Silvia Trigo

The election was the most tightly contested in decades: Evo Morales, Bolivia’s
first Indigenous president, was running for a fourth term, facing an opposition
that saw him as authoritarian and unwilling to relinquish power. 

As the preliminary vote count began, on Oct. 20, 2019, tensions ran high. When
the tallying stopped — suddenly and without explanation — then resumed again a
full day later, it showed Mr. Morales had just enough votes to eke out a
victory. 

Amid suspicions of fraud, protests broke out across the country, and the
international community turned to the Organization of American States, which had
been invited to observe the elections, for its assessment. 

The organization’s statement, which cited “an inexplicable change” that
“drastically modifies the fate of the election,” heightened doubts about the
fairness of the vote and fueled a chain of events that changed the South
American nation’s history. The opposition seized on the claim to escalate
protests, gather international support, and [push Mr. Morales from power][push]{:target="_blank"} with
military support weeks later. 

Now, [a study by independent researchers][study]{:target="_blank"}, using data obtained by The New York
Times from the Bolivian electoral authorities, has found that the Organization
of American States’ statistical analysis was itself flawed. 

The conclusion that Mr. Morales’s share of the vote jumped inexplicably in the
final ballots relied on incorrect data and inappropriate statistical techniques,
the researchers found. 

“We took a hard look at the O.A.S.’s statistical evidence and found problems
with their methods,” said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist who teaches Latin
American studies at Tulane University. “Once we correct those problems, the
O.A.S.’s results go away, leaving no statistical evidence of fraud.” 

Mr. Rodríguez conducted the study with Dorothy Kronick, an expert on Latin
American politics at the University of Pennsylvania, and Nicolás Idrobo, a
doctoral student at the same university who is the co-author of a textbook on
advanced statistical methods. Their study is a working paper that has not yet
been peer reviewed.
