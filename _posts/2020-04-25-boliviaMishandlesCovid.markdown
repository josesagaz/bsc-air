**Bolivia's de facto government headed by Jeanine Anez has intensified the
persecution of Evo Morales' partisans and left-leaning movements under the
smokescreen of quarantine measures, says La Resistencia Bolivia journalist
Alberto Echazu, denouncing La Paz' response to the COVID-19 crisis as highly
insufficient.**


The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted [Bolivia's de facto government in La Paz to
postpone the snap elections][Bolivia]{:target="_blank"} scheduled for 3 May. The outbreak, however, has not
halted the Bolivian political struggle that has been simmering in the country
since the November coup and ouster of former president Evo Morales.


While Bolivia reports just [703][mapa]{:target="_blank"} confirmed COVID-19 cases and 43
coronavirus-related deaths, these figures could be misleading due to the
insufficient number of tests conducted in the landlocked South American country
of over 11.3 million, says Alberto Echazu, a political analyst and journalist
with La Resistencia Bolivia, shedding light on the situation in the country and
ongoing clashes between La Paz and Evo Morales' Movement Towards Socialism
(MAS).


**Sputnik: How do you assess the handling of the coronavirus situation by the de
facto Anez government?  Under Evo Morales, a universal healthcare system was
introduced in the country; is this system still up and running? How does La Paz'
decision to expel hundreds of Cuban doctors in November 2019 affect the
country's medical care in general?**


**Alberto Echazu:** The de facto government has shown its incapacity in the handling
of the pandemic, and is aggravating the situation by making improvised
decisions. The government's economic policy has created a serious crisis for the
lower classes, as they simply cannot stay at home during the quarantine. A large
part of the population makes its living on a daily basis as they rely on trade
activities and can't afford to miss a single working day. Their need to go out
during the lockdown is leaving them in a vulnerable situation. This situation is
caused by the de facto regime that believes that a couple of bonds, which even
put together don´t make the amount of a minimum wage, are enough to sustain a
household.

>On the other hand, the health and sanitary situation is just as bad, as Bolivia
>is the country with the fewest nunber of tests done in South America, making the
>number of COVID-19 cases deceptively low as a result of the regime´s policy of
>only performing tests on people who show symptoms. This fact has prompted
>suspicion that the real number of cases (and this could also mean deaths) is
>higher than what the official data says.

The universal healthcare programme is not used, and this, together with the
expulsion of [the contingent of Cuban doctors][cuban]{:target="_blank"}, has undermined the capacity of
(Bolivia's) health system. There is an alarming shortage of biosecurity
equipment and medical personnel, which have triggered repeated protests by
health workers in many regions of the country against the government's handling
of the pandemic.


**Sputnik: How does the pandemic affect the political standoff between MAS and the
de facto government? Do purges of left-leaning activists, politicians and media
continue amid the lockdown regime in Bolivia?**


**Alberto Echazu:** The regime is using the pandemic for its own purposes. The main
objective of the de facto government is [to postpone the elections indefinitely][postpone]{:target="_blank"},
and there even have been reports about their intention to postpone it until the
next year. Their plan is to extend their hold of power for as long as they can,
using the state apparatus to propel Anez’s candidature.
