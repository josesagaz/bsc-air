La Paz, November 10, 2019.- President calls for peace, along with social organizations, and calls for the total renewal of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), members of the electoral court and calls for new elections, “I have heard the social organizations,” said the Constitutional President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Evo Morales Ayma.

After taking several public institutions and social organizations, like the worst dictatorships, abuses of violence, discrimination that violate all human rights, especially to the inhabitants of the city of El Alto, attacks of the Police on neighbors Alteños who came out in defense of President Evo Morales.

The national police, despite having declared a mutiny, which does not act in the same way with the right-wing vandalism groups, has directly attacked the popular masses that rose in favor of the constitutional president Evo Morales Ayma.

The historic town of El Alto, again rises in view of the coup, as they done in 2003, and the media, especially television, simplified its analysis saying that there is a struggle "of Bolivians against Bolivians." Who determined who is involved in the conflict and who doesn't? Only the "organizaciones civicas"? Who chose them, who does it represent?
