## Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has spoken out in support of his Bolivian “brother” who he believes was unfairly ousted from the presidency last month. Evo Morales has been living in exile in Mexico since November 12.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Sunday that former Bolivian leader Evo Morales was the “victim of a coup d’etat” and described him as “our brother.”

Lopez Obrador made the declaration as he celebrated his first year in office with a speech to crowds of supporters in the center of Mexico City.

“In accordance with our exemplary tradition of offering refuge to persecuted politicians around the world, we decided to grant humanitarian and political asylum to the president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and his vice president, Álvaro García Linera,” the Mexican leader said during the rally in Plaza del Zocalo.

“Evo is not only our brother who represents with dignity the majority indigenous people of Bolivia. Evo was the victim of a coup d’etat! And from Mexico, we tell the world, ‘Yes to democracy, no to militarism,’” Lopez Obrador said.

It is the first time that Lopez Obrador spoke directly about the circumstances that led to Morales’s departure from Bolivia. Bolivia’s first ever indigenous president has yet to meet publicly with Lopez Obrador.

Morales resigned on November 10 amid protests over what political opponents claimed was his rigging of October 20 elections.

He fled to Mexico a day later after losing the support of the military and police, claiming to be the victim of a coup.

While echoing the Bolivian exiled leader’s claim, Mexico’s president described Morales as “our brother, who represents with dignity the majority of indigenous people of Bolivia.”
