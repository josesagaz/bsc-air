## There is a perfect word in the English language for when army generals appear on television demanding the resignation of an elected head of state while their allies detain and torture government officials.
### by Alan Macleod 

Bolivian President Evo Morales “resigned” at gunpoint Sunday, after army
generals publicly demanded his resignation, despite convincingly winning
re-election just three weeks ago.

The preceding 21 days were filled with fractious demonstrations and
counter-protests from Morales’ supporters and opponents. On October 20, Morales
had secured enough votes to win the election outright in the first round without
the need for a run-off against his closest challenger, Carlos Mesa. However,
Mesa cried fraud, citing supposed irregularities in the vote-counting procedure,
claiming Morales did not receive the requisite vote share to ensure his victory.
The Organization of American States (OAS) and the U.S. government repeated this
claim, although neither group provided evidence of fraud. Morales invited the
OAS to audit the election as he was confident of its veracity. Indeed, a report
by the Washington-based Center for Economic Policy Research found that the vote
totals were “consistent” with those announced, finding no irregularities
whatsoever. Despite this, the local U.S.-backed opposition went on the attack.
 
### Right-Wing Rampage
On Saturday, veteran political scientists Noam Chomsky and Vijay Prashad warned
that “a coup is brewing against the elected government” of Bolivia, expressing
their concern at the “fascistic” violence percolating throughout the country. In
Santa Cruz, a stronghold of the wealthy white elite who oppose Morales, the
office of the electoral authority was burned down. Meanwhile, in Vinto,
opposition groups kidnapped local mayor Patricia Arce, cut her hair off and
painted her body red, publicly dragging her through the streets and abusing her,
forcing her to commit to leaving office.
