# Demonstration in London in repudiation of the coup in Bolivia
## from: Katerina Annis

On the 23rd of November we held a demonstration in London in repudiation of the coup in Bolivia, and to condemn the grave human rights abuses, the racism, the repression and the massacres that have taken place since the coup regime took power. We stopped by the headquarters of the Guardian newspaper to protest against its shocking coverage in the first few days of the coup which sought to justify the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Evo Morales. A newspaper which sees itself as a defender of liberal values and is read by many on the left should not be repeating US State Department propaganda or far-right talking points, yet this is often the stance the Guardian takes in its coverage of Latin America.
