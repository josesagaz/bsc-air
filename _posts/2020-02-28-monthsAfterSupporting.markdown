## Democracy in Bolivia did not die in darkness, it died to the applause of the Washington Post.

### by Alan Macleod 

The *Washington Post* published an [op-ed][1]{:target="_blank"} yesterday from a research team at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology showing that there was no fraud in the
October elections in Bolivia after all. The *Post* had for months claimed that
President Evo Morales won the election fraudulently, thus justifying the
[U.S.-backed][2]{:target="_blank"} coup that ousted him weeks later. There simply “isn’t statistical
support for the claims of vote fraud,” the research team concluded.

While the *Post* deserves some credit for publishing the findings at all and for
accurately using the word “coup” to describe the events – something much of the
media refused to do – there are still a number of glaring errors and omissions
with the new *Post* line. For one, the article frames the events leading to
Morales’ ouster as “protests” that police joined. A more honest framing would be
that the powerful right-wing opposition conducted a campaign of terrorist
violence that included burning down the houses of and kidnapping elected
officials from Morales’ Movement to Socialism (MAS) party. For example, Patricia
Arce, Mayor of the town of Vinto, was kidnapped, had her cut her hair off and
her body painted red, and was publicly dragged through the streets and abused,
with her captors forcing her to commit to leaving office. Morales made clear he
was only stepping down due to the threat of increased violence.

Though the media reports otherwise, the coup against Evo Morales in Bolivia is  just the latest example of US interference in Latin
 America.</span>
